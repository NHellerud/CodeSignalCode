//ShapeArea
//Desciption: Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.
//
//A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by 
//taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. 

int shapeArea(int n) {
    int area = 1;
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    {
        area += 4 * (i - 1);
    }
    return area;
}
